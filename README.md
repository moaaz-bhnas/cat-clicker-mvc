## Cat Clicker
The idea is taken from [Cow Clicker](http://bogost.com/writing/blog/cow_clicker_1/) facebook game where you click a cow every 6 hours. Here you click a cat, the number increases by one.  
As I like playing with colors, the whole interface color theme changes depending on the cat's color. You can also add your cat with its own color :D
